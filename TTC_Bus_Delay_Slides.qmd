## Summary

## Introduction

## Analysis

1. **Loading and Preprocessing Data** 
2. **Visualization** 
3. **Modelling**

## Analysis: Loading and Preprocessing Data 
- Handle missing values, 
- Convert timestamp data to day parts, and 
- Clean data fields irrelevant to the analysis


## Analysis: Visualization 
- Analyze distribution of delays, 
- Identify top routes and locations with frequent delay incidents, and
- Visualize delays based on day and incident type

## Analysis: Modelling
- Logistic Regression model to predict
    - "Short", "Medium" or "Long" duration
- Cross-validation and randomized grid for hyperparameter tuning
